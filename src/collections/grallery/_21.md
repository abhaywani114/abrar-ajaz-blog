caption: The Naksibendis are the Masters of the Caravan, Who guide to the Sacred
  House using the Secret Road. All the Lions of the Universe are connected to
  this Silsila (Chain), How could foxes ever tear us apart? May Allah keep us
  with those Lions of the Universe. Amin - Mevlana Jami (ق), who was a Murid of
  Khwaja Ubaydullah Ahrar (ق)
