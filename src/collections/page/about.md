Abrar Ajaz Wani was born on the 25th of November 1999 in Sogam Lolab, a small village in the Kashmir Valley, in the Ju Wani family. He attended Army Goodwill School for schooling and later joined SSM College for Engineering. He pledged his allegiance (bayt) to Hazrat Sheykh Lokman Effendi, a saint in the Osmanli Naqashbandi Spiritual Order. Wani believes in taking a different path than the normal to become immortal.

He pursued computer science and conducted two pieces of research in the field, resulting in the invention of a keyboard called "Keyboard for Blind People" and "Auto Electricity Generator Modal." Wani received awards and international appreciation from scientists like Ajay Bhat of Intel, USA. He was titled as a Child Scientist in the 103rd International Science Congress held at the University of Mysore, Karnataka. Wani participated in the Child Science Congress session and exhibited his project KBP.

Wani learned Persian astrology during his schooling. His favorite poets include Ghalib of Urdu, whom he loves for his deep ideas of mysticism, and Mohsin Naqvi, whom he finds as an outstanding poetic idol. Wani's poems generally speak of Sufism and love. He has written praises for Prophet Muhammad AS, his Sheykh Effendi, and other saints as well.
